# CustomArenaMemoryAllocator
This project is a C++ "best-fit" arena memory allocator. I made this allocator to help myself learn about C++ and the fundementals of memory allocation.

This allocator allows you to set a max size for the heap object, allocate memory into the heap, free memory from the heap and keep track of the size of allocations via their pointers.
